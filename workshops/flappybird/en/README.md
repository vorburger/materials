#Create your own Flappy Bird

##Introduction

The workshop 'Create your own Flappy Bird' is a workshop for kids to learn how to make a game. We start with a Future Lesson, not a history lesson. In this lesson we show a few videos about new technologies, such as dancing robots, wearables. Just to show the kids what is possible with technology and coding.

The game will be created with HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Also we use a library call Phaser.IO. First we'll give a short introduction into these technologies and then we start coding!
